## Local Storage (Data Saving)

This tool automatically saves your slide numbers, headers, and notes to your browser's internal memory every time you type or navigate.

**How long does it last?**

* **Forever.** It does not expire. You can restart your computer, keep it off for a month, and come back—the data will still be there.

**Will clearing "History" delete it?**

* It depends on which box you check.
* **Safe:** If you only clear "Browsing history" (the list of websites you visited), your data is safe.
* **Not Safe:** If you clear "Cookies and other site data", your data will be deleted.



**Important Rules to avoid losing data:**

1. **Do not move the file:** If you move the `.html` file to a different folder on your computer, the browser will treat it like a "new website" and your data won't be there. Keep the file in the same place.
2. **Do not use Incognito/Private Mode:** Private windows delete everything the moment you close them. Use a normal window.
3. **Same Browser:** If you open the file in Chrome today, and then try to open it in Edge tomorrow, the data won't transfer. It stays in the browser you started with.

## Settings

Click the **Gear Icon** in the top-left corner to access settings:

* **Switch Mode:** Toggle between Numbered tracking and Visual Pulse tracking.
* **Number Size:** Slider to adjust the size of the corner indicator.
* **Text Size:** Slider to adjust the size of your headers and notes.
* **Reset All:** Wipes all saved data and starts fresh from Slide 0.

## How to Use

1. Save the code as an `.html` file.
2. Open the file in any modern web browser.
3. Type your header or notes for the current slide.
4. Use the **Arrow Keys** to advance slides.
